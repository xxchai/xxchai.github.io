My name is Chai Xiaoxiang (Chinese characthers: 柴小祥; Hangul: 차이 샤오샹).
I am a BK21 postdoctoral fellow (mentor: [[https://sites.google.com/site/mathbeomjun/][Beomjun Choi]], Mar 2023 ~ now) in POSTECH.

I was a research fellow at [[http://kias.re.kr][Korea Institute for Advanced Study]] (mentors: Feb 2020 ~ Feb 2023, [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Inkang_Kim][Prof. Inkang Kim]]; Mar 2019 ~ Feb 2020, [[http://newton.kias.re.kr/~choe/][Prof. Choe Jaigyoung]]). Before that, I was a PhD student (graduated on July 2018) of the Department of Mathematics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. My advisors were [[http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~martinli/][Prof. Martin Man-chun Li]] and Prof. Tam Luen-fai (co-advisor).
